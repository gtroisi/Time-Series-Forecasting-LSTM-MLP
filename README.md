# Time Series Forecasting of Air Pollutant with LSTM and MLP models

## Introduction
The following code implements the code for Air Pollutant spread, using two datasets: 2018 data as training set and 2019 as validation test. The forecasting is made for 2020 using LSTM and MLP models.

## Contents
- *data_to_load_in_db* directory contains the original JSON dataset (from ARPA),
- *Time_Series_Forecasting.ipynb* implements the following operations: data collection, data cleaning, data augmentation, Time-Series forecasting with LSTM and MLP models.

## Conclusion
See notebook for conclusions.
